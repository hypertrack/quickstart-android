## Publishable Key

We use Publishable Key to identify your devices. To get one:
1. Go to the [Signup page](https://v3.dashboard.hypertrack.com/signup). Enter your email address and password.
2. Open the verification link sent to your inbox.
3. Open the [Keys page](https://v3.dashboard.hypertrack.com/account/keys), where you can copy your Publishable Key.

Next, you can [start with the Quickstart app](#quickstart-app), or can [integrate the SDK](#integrate-the-sdk) in your app.

## Quickstart app
#### Step 1. Open this project in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)
![Android-Studio-quickstart-android](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10487613/53929273-0eb0d580-4042-11e9-9736-51fbb7945bfd.png)

#### Step 2. Set your Publishable key

1. Add the publishable key to [MyApplication](https://github.com/hypertrack/quickstart-android/blob/42ccbfc62cc06c049e695d7c8c6fcf4c46f214eb/app/src/main/java/com/hypertrack/quickstart/MyApplication.java#L16) file.

2. Run project on your device use simulator instance.

3. Go through one-time permission flow (applicable for Android M and later).

#### Step 3. Check your location on the HyperTrack [dashboard](https://v3.dashboard.hypertrack.com/devices)

## Integrate the SDK
 - [Add Hypertrack SDK](#step-1-add-hypertrack-sdk)
 - [Initialize SDK](#step-2-initialize-sdk)
 - [Ask for permission](#step-3-get-location-permission)
 - [Cleanup resources](#step-4-cleanup-resources)
 - [Manage tracking (optional)](#step-5-optional-manage-tracking-state)
 - [Customize notification icon (optional)](#step-6-optional-customize-foreground-service-notification)
 - [Identify devices (optional)](#step-7-optional-identify-devices)

#### Step 1. Add Hypertrack SDK
Add following lines to your applications `build.gradle`:
```
// Import the SDK within your repositories block
repositories {
    maven { url 'http://hypertrack-core-android.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/' }
    ...
}

//Add HyperTrack as a dependency
dependencies {
    implementation("com.hypertrack:hypertrack:3.0.2@aar"){
        transitive = true;
    }
    ...
}
```

#### Step 2. Initialize SDK
Add SDK init call to your _Application's_ `onCreate()` callback:
```java
@Override
public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    HyperTrack.initialize(getApplicationContext(),getString(R.string.your_publishable_key));
}
```

#### Step 3. Get location permission
Ask for `location permission` when appropriate, passing _listener_ to receive callback.
```java
if (!HyperTrack.checkLocationPermission(this)) {
    HyperTrack.requestPermissions(mPermissionCallback);
    return;
}
```

#### Step 4. Cleanup resources
Add `HyperTrack.onStop()` call to your Application's `onTerminate()` callback
```java
@Override
public void onTerminate() {
    super.onTerminate();
    HyperTrack.onStop();
}
```

#### Step 5. _(optional)_ Manage tracking state
Depending on your needs, you can always _pause_ and _resume_ tracking, invoking `HyperTrack.pauseTracking()` and `HyperTrack.resumeTracking()` SDK methods.

#### Step 6. _(optional)_ Customize foreground service notification
HyperTrack tracking runs as a separate foreground service, so when tracking is ON, your users will see a persistent notification. By default, it displays your app icon with text `{app name} is running` but you can customize it anytime after initialization by calling:
```java
HyperTrack.addNotificationIconsAndTitle(
    R.drawable.ic_small,
    R.drawable.ic_large,
    notificationTitleText,
    notificationBodyText
);
```

#### Step 7. (optional) Identify devices
All devices tracked on HyperTrack are uniquely identified using [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). You can get this identifier programmatically in your app by calling `HyperTrack.getDeviceId()` after initialization.
Another approach is to tag device with a name that will make it easy to distinguish them on HyperTrack Dashboard.
```java
HyperTrack.setNameAndMetadataForDevice(name, metaData);
```

#### You are all set

You can now run the app and start using HyperTrack. You can see your devices on the [dashboard](#dashboard).

## Dashboard

Once your app is running, go to the [Dashboard page](https://v3.dashboard.hypertrack.com/devices) where you can see a list of all your devices and their location on the map.

![Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10487613/53848754-6bd95800-3f6a-11e9-8464-580f791f3eea.png)

## Frequently Asked Questions
- [What API levels (Android versions) are supported](#supported-versions)
- [NoClassDefFoundError](#javalangnoclassdeffounderror)
- [Handling dependency conflicts](#dependencies)
- [Persistent notification](#persistent-notification)
- [Handling custom ROMs](#handling-custom-roms)


#### Supported versions
Currently we do support all of the Android versions starting from API 19 (Android 4.4 Kit Kat)

#### java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError
I've added SDK and my app started failing with message like `Fatal Exception: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError`.
The reason of it, is that on Android API level 19 and below you cannot have more than 65536 methods in your app (including libraries methods). Please, check [this Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34997835/fatal-exception-java-lang-noclassdeffounderror-when-calling-static-method-in-an) answer for solutions.

#### Dependencies
SDK dependencies graph looks like below:

    +--- com.android.volley:volley:1.1.0
    +--- com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5
    +--- org.greenrobot:eventbus:3.1.1
    +--- com.parse.bolts:bolts-tasks:1.4.0
    +--- net.grandcentrix.tray:tray:0.12.0
    |    \--- com.android.support:support-annotations:26.0.1
    \--- com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:16.0.0
         +--- com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:16.0.1
         |    +--- com.google.android.gms:play-services-basement:16.0.1
         |    |    \--- com.android.support:support-v4:26.1.0

         |    |         |    \--- com.android.support:support-compat:26.1.0
         |    |         +--- com.android.support:support-core-utils:26.1.0
         |    |         +--- com.android.support:support-core-ui:26.1.0
         |    |         \--- com.android.support:support-fragment:26.1.0
         |    \--- com.google.android.gms:play-services-tasks:16.0.1
         |         \--- com.google.android.gms:play-services-basement:16.0.1
         +--- com.google.android.gms:play-services-basement:16.0.1
         +--- com.google.android.gms:play-services-places-placereport:16.0.0
         |    \--- com.google.android.gms:play-services-basement:16.0.1
         \--- com.google.android.gms:play-services-tasks:16.0.1

Common problem here is depending on different versions of `com.android.support` library components. You can explicitly specify required version by adding it as a dependency in your app's `build.gradle`, e.g.:
```
  implementation `com.android.support:support-v4:28.0.0`
```
That will take precedence over SDK version and you'll have one version of support library on your classpath.


#### Persistent notification
HyperTrack SDK, by default, runs as a foreground service. This is to ensure that the location tracking works reliably even when your app is minimized. A foreground service is a service that the user is actively aware of and isn't a candidate for the system to kill when low on memory.
Android mandates that a foreground service provides a persistent notification in the status bar. This means that the notification cannot be dismissed by the user.

![persistent-notification](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10487613/54007190-6ec47c00-4115-11e9-9743-332befbcf8f5.png)

#### Handling custom ROMs
Smartphones are getting more and more powerful, but the battery capacity is lagging behind. Device manufactures are always trying to squeeze some battery saving features into the firmware with each new Android release. Manufactures like Xiaomi, Huawei and OnePlus have their own battery savers that kills the services running in the background. Read more.
To avoid OS killing the service, users of your app need to override the automatic battery management and set it manual. To inform your users and direct them to the right setting page, you may add the following code in your app. This would intent out your user to the right settings page on the device.
```
try {
    Intent intent = new Intent();
    String manufacturer = android.os.Build.MANUFACTURER;
    if ("xiaomi".equalsIgnoreCase(manufacturer)) {
        intent.setComponent(new ComponentName("com.miui.securitycenter", "com.miui.permcenter.autostart.AutoStartManagementActivity"));
    }
    else if ("oppo".equalsIgnoreCase(manufacturer)) {
        intent.setComponent(new ComponentName("com.coloros.safecenter", "com.coloros.safecenter.permission.startup.StartupAppListActivity"));
    }
    else if ("vivo".equalsIgnoreCase(manufacturer)) {
        intent.setComponent(new ComponentName("com.vivo.permissionmanager", "com.vivo.permissionmanager.activity.BgStartUpManagerActivity"));
    }

    List<ResolveInfo> list = context.getPackageManager().queryIntentActivities(intent, PackageManager.MATCH_DEFAULT_ONLY);
    if  (list.size() > 0) {
        context.startActivity(intent);
    }
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        Crashlytics.logException(e);
}
```
